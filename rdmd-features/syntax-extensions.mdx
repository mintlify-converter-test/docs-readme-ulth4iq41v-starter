## Custom Blocks

### Code Tabs

A tabbed interface for displaying multiple code blocks. These are written nearly identically to a series of vanilla markdown code snippets, except for their distinct _lack_ of an additional line break separating each subsequent block. [**Syntax & examples**.](/rdmd/docs/code-blocks)

### Callouts

Callouts are very nearly equivalent to standard Markdown block quotes in their syntax, other than some specific requirements on their content: To be considered a “callout”, the block quote must start with an initial emoji, which is used to determine the callout's theme. [**Syntax & examples**.](/rdmd/docs/callouts)

### Embeds

Embedded content is written as a simple Markdown link, with a title of "@embed". [**Syntax & examples**.](/rdmd/docs/embeds)

## Standard Markdown

The engine also supports all standard markdown constructs, as well as CommonMark options, and most GitHub syntax extensions.
